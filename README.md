# A Responsive Web Application for Medicine Prescription Digitalization and Drugstore Locator.

Today's people have more access to health information than ever before and as they get used to the advantages of technology, they start seeking the same benefits from their health services' personalization, power, and convenience.
The medical prescription is a central artifact of a relationship between doctor and patient. According to a report filed by MISMOTODAY, there are 70,000 active physicians in the Philippines. By that number an estimated more than a million of paper prescriptions are written every year.


Paper prescriptions can be easily shredded and can be dampened anytime. It can also be lost easily. This system that has been proposed by the Development Team aims to move paper prescription methodology in digital space.


It is well known that physicians have scribbled handwritings. Typically, the writer understands what is written, but issues like errors arises when other people are involved on how the text being read and interpreted. In this project we are trying to resolve this problem by using digital inputs instead of handwritten and converting the digitally input prescriptions into a document file.


Another problem of patients in medicine prescription to small scale pharmacies are the unavailability of medicines in store. The Development Team observe that there is a lack of e-commerce support in small scale pharmacies like websites or applications here in the Philippines.
